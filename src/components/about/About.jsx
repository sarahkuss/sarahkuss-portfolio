          <p>I am former zookeeper who decided to completely change careers and become a part of the tech industry.
            Although zookeeping was an incredible, one-of-a-kind job, I reached a point where I realized I was no longer learning.
            I was falling behind in the modern world and lost sight of my passion- conservation. That's when I realized I could have the best of both worlds. My goal is to connect people with conservation through technology! </p>
